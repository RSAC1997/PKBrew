The personal data are coming from [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX).

The original sprites are mainly coming from [veekun.com](http://veekun.com/).

The text data are coming from [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) and [veekun.com](http://veekun.com/).

We made from scratch (but still inspired by the original):
* The resume background [resume_background.png]
* The resume symbols (such as the hearth, the hexagon, the star, the gen icons,..) [box_tiles.png]
* ( The organisation of the spritesheets. )
