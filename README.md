**PKBrew**: A romfs repo for Pokémon homebrew.

***

The text and the personal data are coming from PKHex, a Kaphotics's project.
The original sprites are mainly coming from [veekun.com](http://veekun.com/).

We made from scratch (but still inspired by the original):
* The resume background [resume_background.png]
* The resume symbols (such as the hearth, the hexagon, the star, the gen icons,..) [box_tiles.png]
* ( The organisation of the spritesheets. )

Thanks to @kwsch, @Slashcash, @suloku, @veekun, @gocario and Nintendo.
